    'Currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine. I have a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. I have previously interned at three companies where I worked as a full stack app developer where I worked on the front-end using Flutter and implemented back-end APIs in nodeJs and I also worked with databases such as MongoDB and MySQL. I have also worked on a multitude of personal projects where I explored and worked with different tech stacks. I love coding because I can see my ideas come to life when I am working on a project',
